As a passionate stock market enthusiast, I am always finding ways to earn greater returns among the sectors.

Technology stocks always seemed promising due to their innovation practices, sales potential, and earnings growth potential â€“ all long-term tailwinds.

So, I decided to analyze the performance of the 5 largest tech stocks by market capitalization over the last 5 years and compare their average daily return to the stock market to see what I could find. All data was sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Please see the .pptx file for a PowerPoint presentation of my findings or the PDF file to view the presentation in PDF format.
